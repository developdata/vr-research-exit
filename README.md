VR Research
=================
This project contains the VR for my research into leaving VR. The main gain is based on Kevin Ngo's 
[A-Frame super shooter kit](https://github.com/supermedium/aframe-super-shooter-kit) with an
onboarding and offboarding that I have made.


The project
------------

### A-Frame

The project uses A-Frame as the project uses WebVR. This is for a number of reasons including
accessability and being able to carry out the research remotely if I need to.

### Files
I will try a a number of different things in Aframe to see what works best for the project. The main 
content as always is in index.html, I am keeping other tests to track ideas, they will be in the test.html files



### assets

There are `assets`
